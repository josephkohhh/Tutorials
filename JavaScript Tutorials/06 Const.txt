Const 

A constant is a variable that cannot be reassigned after it is initally assigned

ex.

const x = 3.14

x +=10

console.log(x);

*Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable at ... 

*When you use const to initialize an object, it means that you cannot assign a 
 completely new object to that variable, but you can still modify the properties 
 and values of the object itself
