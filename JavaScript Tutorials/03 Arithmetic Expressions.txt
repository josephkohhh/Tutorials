What is an arithmetic expression?

It is a combination of operands (values, variables, etc) 
operators (+ - * / %) that can be evaluated to a value 

ex. 
let students = 10;
students = students + 10;
students = students - 5;
students = students * 2;
students = students / 2;
let extraStudents = students % 2;

Augmented assignment operator (+= -= *= /= %=)

ex.
let students = 10;
students += 1; 
students -= 1;
students *= 2;
students /= 2;
students %= 2;

Operator precedence
1. parenthesis ()
2. exponents
3. multiplication & division
4. addition & subtraction

ex.
let result = 1 + 2 * (3 + 4) ans: 15
let result = (1 + 2) * (3 + 4) ans: 21
