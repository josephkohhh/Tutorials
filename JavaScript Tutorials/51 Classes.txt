Classes

A blueprint for creating objects
- define what properties and methods they have
- use a constructor for unique properties 

Ex. 

.js

class Player {
    score = 0;

    pause() {
        console.log(`You paused the game`);
    }
    exit() {
        console.log(`You exited the game`);
    }
}

const player1 = new Player();
const player2 = new Player();
const player3 = new Player();

player1.score += 1;
console.log(player1.score);
console.log(player1.pause());
console.log(player2.score);
