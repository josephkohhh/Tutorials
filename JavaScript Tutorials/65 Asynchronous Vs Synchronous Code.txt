Asynchronous Vs Synchronous Code

Synchronous Code 
- in an ordered sequence
- step by step linear equations
- start now, finish now

Asynchronous Code 
- out of sequence
- start now, finish sometime later
- ex. (access db, fetch file, tasks that take time)

Ex.
	
.js

//Synchronous
console.log("START");
console.log("This is Synchronous!");
console.log("END!");

//Asynchronous
console.log("START");
setTimeout(()=> console.log("This is Asynchronous!"),5000);
console.log("END!");
