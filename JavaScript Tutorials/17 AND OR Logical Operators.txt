AND OR Logical Operators 

Gives us the ability to check more than 1 condition concurrently
- && AND (Both conditions must be true)
- || OR (Either condition can be true)

Ex.

.js

let temp = 20;
let sunny = true;

if (temp >= 15 && temp <= 25 && sunny) {
    console.log("Weather is good!");
}
else {
    console.log("Weather is bad!");
}

let color = "black"

if (color == "red" || color == "blue") {
    console.log("This is my favorite color!")
} else {
    console.log("Not my favorite color!")

}
