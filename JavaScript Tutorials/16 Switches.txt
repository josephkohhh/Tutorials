Switches 

A statement that examines a value for a match against many case clauses.
More efficient that many "else if" statements

Ex.

.js

let grades = "A";
let points = 50;

switch (grades) {
    case "A":
        console.log("You did great!");
        break;
    case "B":
        console.log("You did good!");
        break;
    case "C":
        console.log("You did ok");
        break;
    case "D":
        console.log("You did poor...");
        break;
    case "E":
        console.log("You did badly...");
        break;
    default:
        console.log(grades, "is not a letter grade");
}

switch (true) {
    case points >= 85:
        console.log("You are a platinum member");
        break;
    case points >= 75:
        console.log("You are gold member");
        break;
    case points >= 60:
        console.log("You are silver member");
        break;
    case points >= 50:
        console.log("You are bronze member");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("You are not a member");
}
