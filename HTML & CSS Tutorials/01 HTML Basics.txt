        Weight of the world on your shoulders
        I'll kiss your waist and ease your mind
        I must be favored to know ya
        I'll take my hands and trace your lines

        It's the way that we can ride
        It's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
        Think I met you in another life
        So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
        You wrap around me and you give me life
        And that's why night after night
        I'll be lovin' you right

        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
        Saturday, Sunday (a week)
        Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
        Seven days a week
        Every hour, every minute, every second
        You know night after night
        I'll be lovin' you right, seven days a week

        You love when I jump right in
        All of me, I'm offering
        Show you what devotion is
        Deeper than the ocean is
        Wind it back, I'll take it slow
        Leave you with that afterglow
        Show you what devotion is
        Deeper than the ocean is

        It's the way that we can ride
        It's the way that we can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
        Think I met you in another life
        So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
        You wrap around me and you give me life
        And that's why night after night
        I'll be lovin' you right, oh-oh-oh-oh

        Take your phone and put it in the camera roll
        Leave them clothes at the door
        Watchu waitin' for? Better come and hit yo' goals
        Uh, he jump in it, both feet
        Goin' 'til the sun up, we ain't gettin' no sleep
        Seven days a week, seven different sheets
        Seven different angles, I could be your fantasy

        Open up, say, "Ah"
        Come here, baby, let me swallow yo' pride
        What you on? I can match your vibe
        Hit me up and I'ma Cha Cha Slide
        You make Mondays feel like weekends
        I make him never think 'bout cheatin' (uh)
