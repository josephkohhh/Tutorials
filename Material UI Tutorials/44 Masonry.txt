Masonry 

This component is under lab package development 
- is under development before they are part of core package
- already at the stage where you can start using them
- to use them, install lab package (Currently @mui/lab has a peer dependency conflict with React 18)
  Step 1: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled  
  Step 2: npm install lab @mui/material

It maintains a list of content blocks with a consistent width but different height
- contents are ordered by row, if row is already filled with specified columns, the next
  item starts in another row and is added to the shortest column to optimise the use of space
- to use Masonry,
  - import { Masonry } from "@mui/lab";
- Eg. Showcase a gallery


Ex.

MuiMasonry.tsx

import {
  Box,
  Paper,
  Accordion,
  AccordionSummary,
  AccordionDetails,
  Typography,
} from "@mui/material";
import { Masonry } from "@mui/lab";
import ExpandMoreIcon from "@mui/icons-material/ExpandMore";

export const MuiMasonry = () => {
  const heights = [
    150, 30, 90, 70, 110, 150, 130, 80, 50, 90, 100, 150, 30, 50, 80,
  ];
  return (
    <>
      <Box sx={{ width: "500px", minHeight: "400px" }}>
        <Masonry columns={4} spacing={1}>
          {heights.map((height, index) => (
            <Paper
              key={index}
              sx={{
                display: "flex",
                justifyContent: "center",
                alignItems: "center",
                height,
                border: "1px solid",
              }}
            >
              {index + 1}
            </Paper>
          ))}
        </Masonry>
      </Box>

      <Box sx={{ width: "500px", minHeight: "400px" }}>
        <Masonry columns={4} spacing={1}>
          {heights.map((height, index) => (
            <Paper
              key={index}
              sx={{
                border: "1px solid",
              }}
            >
              <Accordion sx={{ minHeight: height }}>
                <AccordionSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
                  <Typography>Accordion {index + 1}</Typography>
                </AccordionSummary>
                <AccordionDetails>Content</AccordionDetails>
              </Accordion>
            </Paper>
          ))}
        </Masonry>
      </Box>
    </>
